## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries

### Continued development

(1) I found myself in the problem that the screen sizes indicated that I should create the screens for Mobile: 375px & Desktop: 1440px, but those differentiations in the media queries simpky did not made the job for me, it made some of the cards look too crammed, so I ended up cutting the screens at 672px, which it seems like it worked much better. 



(2) I was not able to make the buttons align in every screen size, I'm not particularly sure what to do about this.
